# UnityEngine (Placeholder)
This class library contains place holder classes, methods, properties, and fields named
as they would be in UnityEngine.dll from Unity. This allows the usage of
Unity Libraries without actaully implementing any of them.

## Examples
- UnityEngine.MonoBehaviour
- UnityEngine.Object
- UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent
- UnityEngine.Events.UnityEvent<T0, T1, T2>
